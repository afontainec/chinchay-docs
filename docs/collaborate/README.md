Welcome to **Chinchay Collaborate**

This section is intended to help you (or anyone) to became part of the Chinchay Community! Chinchay is a beginners friendly environment, if you have any doubt just contact me: [antonio.fontainecorrea@gmail.com](antonio.fontainecorrea@gmail.com).

## Overview


The [Chinchay Repo](https://github.com/afontainec/chinchay) is hosted in github.

* [Github Repository](https://github.com/afontainec/chinchay)
* [Issues](https://github.com/afontainec/chinchay/issues)
* [Pull Requests](https://github.com/afontainec/chinchay/pulls)

Pull Request are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Please make sure to update tests appropriately.

If you want to help but don't know how, contact me [antonio.fontainecorrea@gmail.com](antonio.fontainecorrea@gmail.com) and we will discuss which functionalities of the backlog you can help with.


## Continuous Integration

  For any pull request to be approved will require for the test to pass with a minimmum coverage. Moreover the linter will be checked. Linter warnings are allowed but non-preferred.

  To locally check this run:

  ```
  npm run test
  npm run coverage
  npm run linter
  ```

## commit

For commits, we follow [this guide](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commits).

But in a nutshell every commit must be as follows:

```
git commit -m 'type(context): description
```

or

```
git commit -m 'type(context/subcontext): description
```

*Type* should answer why are you commiting. Choose one of the following:

* **feat:** A new feature
* **fix:** A bug fix
* **docs:** Documentation only changes
* **style:** Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor:** A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf:** A code change that improves performance
* **test:** Adding missing or correcting existing tests
* **chore:** Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

*Context*, or also called scope is what are you working on? In which component, functionality or subdivision of the app are you working on. Optionally you can add a *subcontext*, for giving a more detailed information.

*Description* A description of what are you working on, it should be short. All together the commit shouldn't have more that 100 characters.


## File Structure

To get you started the file structure is as follows: 

```
  .
  ├── chinchapp                  
  ├── cliApp       
  ├── db   
  ├── example              
  ├── models
  └── test
```

There are more files and directories but this is the "main skeleton". Lets dig into each directory:

### chinchapp

If you look into de `.gitignore`, you may notice the content of chinchapp is ignored. So actually this isn't a fundamental part of the package. But is useful for development and debugging. Look at [Running Locally and Debugging](#running-locally-and-debugging) for further information.


### cliApp

Next in line is the cliApp, here is all the code in charge of handeling the Command Line Interface (CLI). If we look at the package.json we will se the following:

```javascript
  "bin": {
    "chinchay": "./cliApp/lector.js"
  },
```

So when we are indicating that when someone rans `chinchay` in the terminal the file `cliApp/lector.js` will be invoked.

The logic within this module is quite simple:

1. `lector.js` recieves the command written by a user in the command line and invokes the corresponding fuction of the `interpreter.js`
2. `interpreter.js` interprets the user input and decide what should be done.
3. The rest of the files are the ones that actually **do the thing**. 

If we would have to do a parallel to a web app, the `lector.js` would be the `router`, the `interpreter` the `controller` and the rest are the `models`.

Full disclosure, this is not the tiddiest part of the package and if you are looking where you could help, this is a strong candidate!

### db

There isn't much to tell about this directory, is where the migrations and seeds for the database are defined. If by this point you are thinking why on earth does Chinchay needs a database for? Well actually it doesn't! The database is just for testing and developing. 

### example

`example` is where all the templates of the files generated by the CLI are. This templates are 'compiled', where the in-text variables are changed by what the user defines. Each in-text variable is delimeted by the $ character. For example:

```
  This is $VARIABLE$
```

If, when compiled a `VARIABLE` key is passed, the in-text variable will be changed. For instance:

```javascript
  fileCreator.compileString('this is  $VARIABLE$', {VARIABLE: 'Chinchay!'})
  >> 'This is a Chinchay'
```
