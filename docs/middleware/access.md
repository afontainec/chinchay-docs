## Overview

 The Access Module has two Functions. The first one is to filter which users can access different content. With the Access Module we can add the corresponding filter so that when the information is fetched to the database only the corresponding coffees are given. Also we can restrict access to certain functionalities, functions, etc.
 
 Second, it will be in charge of generating the access token, the token follows the json web token standard, by generating the token with the [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) npm package.
