So what is a Table Data Gateway? It is a design pattern proposed by [Martin Fowler](https://www.martinfowler.com/). In his own words, a Table Data Gateway holds all the SQL for accessing a single table or view: selects, inserts, updates, and deletes. Other code calls its methods for all interaction with the database. You can read more about [Table Data Gateway here](https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/tableDataGateway.html).
